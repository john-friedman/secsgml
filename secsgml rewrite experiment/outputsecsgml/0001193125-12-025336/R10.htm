<font style="FONT-FAMILY: arial" size="2">The preparation of
consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) requires us to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in
the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results
could differ materially from these estimates. On an ongoing basis,
we evaluate our estimates, including those related to the accounts
receivable and sales allowances, fair values of financial
instruments, intangible assets and goodwill, useful lives of
intangible assets and property and equipment, fair values of
stock-based awards, income taxes, and contingent liabilities, among
others. We base our estimates on historical experience and on
various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable, the
results of which form the basis for making judgments about the
carrying values of assets and liabilities.</font></p>

<font style="FONT-FAMILY: arial" size="2">Google AdWords is our
auction-based advertising program that enables advertisers to place
text-based and display ads on our websites and our Google Network
Members&#x2019; websites. Display advertising comprises the videos,
text, images, and other interactive ads that run across the web on
computers and mobile devices, including smart phones and handheld
computers such as netbooks and tablets. Most of our AdWords
customers pay us on a cost-per-click basis, which means that an
advertiser pays us only when a user clicks on one of its ads. We
also offer AdWords on a cost-per-impression basis that enables
advertisers to pay us based on the number of times their ads appear
on our websites and our Google Network Members&#x2019; websites as

advertisers using our AdWords cost-per-impression pricing, we
recognize as revenues the fees charged to advertisers each time

<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 6px; TEXT-INDENT: 4%; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px">
<font style="FONT-FAMILY: arial" size="2">Cost of revenues consists
primarily of traffic acquisition costs. Traffic acquisition costs
consist of amounts ultimately paid to our Google Network members
under AdSense arrangements and to certain other partners (our
distribution partners) who distribute our toolbar and other
products (collectively referred to as access points) or otherwise
direct search queries to our website (collectively referred to as
distribution arrangements). These amounts are primarily based on

<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 12px; TEXT-INDENT: 4%; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px">
<font style="FONT-FAMILY: arial" size="2">Certain distribution
arrangements require us to pay our partners based on a fee per
access point delivered and not exclusively&#x2014;or at
all&#x2014;based on revenue share. These fees are non-refundable.
Further, these arrangements are terminable at will, although under
the terms of certain contracts we or our distribution partners may
be subject to penalties in the event of early termination. We
recognize fees under these arrangements over the estimated useful
lives of the access points (approximately two years) to the extent
we can reasonably estimate those lives and they are longer than one
year, or based on any contractual revenue share, if greater.
Otherwise, the fees are charged to expense as incurred. The
estimated useful life of the access points is based on the
historical average period of time they generate traffic and
revenues. Further, we review the access points for impairment by
distribution partner, type, and geography, and we have not made any
impairment to date.</font></p>

amortization of acquired intangible assets, as well as content
acquisition costs. We have entered into arrangements with certain
content providers under which we distribute or license their video
and other content. In a number of these arrangements, we display
ads on the pages of our web sites from which the content is viewed
and share most of the fees these ads generate with the content
providers. To the extent we are obligated to make guaranteed
minimum revenue share&#xA0;payments to our content providers, we
recognize as content acquisition costs&#xA0;the contractual revenue
share amount or on a straight-line basis, whichever is greater,

<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 6px; TEXT-INDENT: 4%; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px">
<font style="FONT-FAMILY: arial" size="2">Our revenues are
principally derived from online advertising, the market for which
is highly competitive and rapidly changing. In addition, our
revenues are generated from a multitude of vertical market segments
in countries around the world. Significant changes in this industry
or changes in customer buying or advertiser spending behavior could
adversely affect our operating results.</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 12px; TEXT-INDENT: 4%; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px">
<font style="FONT-FAMILY: arial" size="2">Financial instruments
that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk
consist principally of cash equivalents, marketable securities,
foreign exchange contracts, and accounts receivable. Cash
equivalents and marketable securities consist primarily of highly
liquid debt instruments of the U.S. government and its agencies,
municipalities in the U.S., debt instruments issued by foreign
governments, mortgage-backed securities, corporate securities, time
deposits, and money market and other funds, including cash
collateral received related to our securities lending program.
Foreign exchange contracts are transacted with various financial
institutions with high credit standing. Accounts receivable are
typically unsecured and are derived from revenues earned from
customers located around the world. In 2009, 2010, and 2011, we
generated approximately 47%, 48%, and 46% of our revenues from
customers based in the U.S., with the majority of customers outside
of the U.S. located in Europe and Japan. Many of our Google Network
Members are in the internet industry. We perform ongoing
evaluations to determine customer credit and we limit the amount of
credit we extend, but generally we do not require collateral from
our customers. We maintain reserves for estimated credit losses and
these losses have generally been within our
expectations.</font></p>

<font style="FONT-FAMILY: arial" size="2">In June 2011, the FASB
issued an amendment to an existing accounting
standard&#xA0;which&#xA0;requires companies to present net income
and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement or in
two separate, but consecutive, statements.&#xA0;In addition, in
December 2011, the FASB issued an amendment to an existing
accounting standard which defers the requirement to present
components of reclassifications of other comprehensive income on
the face of the income statement.&#xA0;We adopted both standards in
the fourth quarter of 2011.</font></p>

<font style="FONT-FAMILY: arial" size="2">In September 2011, the
FASB issued an amendment to an existing accounting standard, which
provides entities an option to&#xA0;perform a qualitative
assessment to determine whether further impairment testing on
goodwill is&#xA0;necessary. Specifically, an entity has the option
to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it
is&#xA0;necessary to perform the current two-step test.&#xA0;If an
entity believes, as a result of its&#xA0;qualitative assessment,
that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a
reporting&#xA0;unit is less than its carrying amount, the
quantitative impairment test is required.&#xA0;Otherwise, no
further testing is required. This standard is effective for annual
and interim goodwill impairment tests&#xA0;performed for fiscal
years beginning after December&#xA0;15, 2011.&#xA0;We adopted this
standard in the first quarter of 2012 and the adoption will not
have a material impact on our financial statements.</font></p>

<font style="FONT-FAMILY: arial" size="2">In May 2011, the FASB
issued a new accounting standard update, which amends the fair

fiscal years beginning after December&#xA0;15, 2011.&#xA0;We
